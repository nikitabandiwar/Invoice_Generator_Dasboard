### `Working of the Invoice Generator :`
(https://youtu.be/vXO60e9ZE9U)



### This project contains three models:  Client , Product/Services , Invoices. 
--We can --
`login with user`
`add/ delete invoices, clients, product , services .`


#### Connecting to Database:
```
$ sudo service postgresql start
$ sudo -u postgres psql
```
#### Database Created-- `invoice`

Granted all privileges on database:
```
ALTER ROLE invoiceuser SET client_encoding TO 'utf-8';
ALTER ROLE invoiceuser SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE invoiceuser SET timezone to 'Asia/Calcutta';
```

#### Creating a virtual Environment:
```
$ source invoiceenv/bin/activate
```
#### `Installing Django and psycopg2--`
```
pip install django
pip install psycopg2
```

#### Invoicing Project created - Django

So the directory workspace breakdown is-
`(invoiceenv)nikita@Desktop:/mnt/c/development/invoicing/invoicing/invoicing$ ls -l`

This shows the files created in the directory.

#### Edit the settings.py to be able to connect to the database-
nano settings.py

```
import os
TIMEZONE='Asia/Calcutta'
DEBUG= True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=[*]
```
#### --Running migrations to set up database: 
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
#### `Create an admin user that you can log in to the admin panel:`
```
Username:
Email address:
Password:
#Superuser created successfully
```

### `TO RUN THE SERVER :`
```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:5000
```
#### `To generate ssh key:`
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
Enter the desired passphrase:
Key's randomart image is created and displayed.
```

#### `--Installing uuids to make unique id s for slugs inside of the models `
![image](https://github.com/nikitabandiwar/Invoice_Generator_Dasboard/assets/104710564/3d448979-fee6-490d-a278-a30fc1c80aea)
#### Use of uuid's:
`So if we find two clients with the same name then we can differentiate on the basis of this unique idâ€™s.

Now in the models.py, we have created such that even if we are generating the invoice @ 1 pm in India . And a subordinate client sees it in U.S it will reflect the time acc. To their timezone.
`


#### Create the Three models:
```
1)Client model
2)Product/services model
3) Invoice Model

```
### `Again run the server :`
```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:5000

```
